# Make a Frontend [Beginner]

## What Specifically Needs to Be Done (Deliverables)
### [1st Deliverable]
Whip up a quick frontend using no-code tools. 
### [Additional Info]
check out this image I drew to help you out
![alt text](../reference/AkashVPN.png). Do something that looks like this. The designer can add images and styling later

**Tools to use:**
- Lovable.dev (drag & drop, super easy)
- Keep it simple, we're not building the next Netflix

**What to make:**
- Landing page that kinda looks like the image
- That's it.

The designer will make it pretty later, so just get the basic structure down.
