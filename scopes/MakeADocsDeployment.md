# Make a Docs Deployment [Beginner]
please deploy an open source documentation solution
## What Specifically Needs to Be Done (Deliverables)
### [1st Deliverable]
Deploy a simple docs site using any open source tool. Pick something easy, we're not building Wikipedia.
### [Additional Info]
none
**Tools to consider:**
- Docusaurus (React-based, super popular)
- GitBook (markdown-based, very simple)
- VuePress (Vue-based, clean and fast)

**What to deploy:**
- Basic docs structure (the FAQ person will write the content)
- Hostable on akash
- Make it look decent (use a theme, don't go crazy)
- Link it to our repo so we can update it

**Keep it simple:**
- Don't over-engineer, just get something working
- Use default themes, don't spend hours customizing
- You don't need to write content, just set up the structure
- We can always make it prettier later
